# Flexize

flex-grow-based panel resizing tool for flexbox.


## Usage

install with npm:

    npm install --save flexize


and include the main script ( from local or cdn if available ):

    <script src="index.min.js"></script>


create a flexize object with the flexbox you'd like to resize:

    fx = new flexize({root: 'selector or the node instance'})


Constructor options:

 - `root`: container element or selector of it. should be a flexbox.
 - `gutter-selector`: optional. default `.flexize-gutter`.
   - selector of nodes that works as bar to be dragged.
 - `fixed-selector`: optional. defaut `.flexize-fixed`.
   - selector of panes that flexize should not resize.


## DOM Construct

flexize is used to support resizing of your panes inside a flexbox. To resize, you need something to drag called `gutter`. Simply add any number of gutters between panes you'd like to resize:

    div(style="display:flex;align-items:stretch")
      div Adjustable by A
      .flexize-gutter(style="width:5px;background:#000") A
      div Adjustable by A
      .flexize-fixed Fixed Size
      div Adjustable by B
      .flexize-gutter(style="width:5px;background:#000") B
      div Adjustable by B

flexize uses `flex-grow` to resize panes so you should:

1. consider `flex-basis` as the minimal width of a panel
2. optional provide initial `flex-grow` as a hint of how the free space should be distribute.
  - flexize will give all free space to the very first non-fixed element if no hint is given.
3. keep `flex-shrink` as 0

Here is another example with flex provided:

    div(style="display:flex;align-items:stretch")
      div(style="flex:1 0 100px")
      .gutter(style="width:5px;background:#000")
      div(style="flex:0 0 100px")

Fixed nodes and Hidden nodes (with `display` set to `none`) will be ignored and all gutters will automatically look up for the next visible panes to resize.


## APIs 

 - `set(list = [])`: manual set flex-grow from values in `list` array.
 - `reset()`: reset space distribution to initial state.
